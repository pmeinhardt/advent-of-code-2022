# Advent of Code 2022

Solutions to puzzles are organized into directories, one directory for each day: `01`, `02`, `03`, â€¦, `24`, `25`.

Implementations for part 1 and 2 of each day are stored as `solve-1` and `solve-2` respectively.

To invoke puzzle implementations from the project root, you can run:

```shell
./solve <day> [part]
```

For instance, `./solve 5` and `./solve 5 1` will invoke day 5 part 1.
Running `./solve 5 2` will solve part 2.

Inputs for each day are read from `input.txt`, e.g. `01/input.txt`.
These input files are `.gitignore`-d.
